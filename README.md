# AI for Biomedicine
Artificial intelligence for biomedicine workshop at the Future of Synthetic Biology Conference 2023 (www.futureofsynbio.org), hosted by the Harvard College OpenBio Laboratory (www.harvardopenbio.org)).

> Ever heard of AI models like GPT-4 or AlphaFold? Interested in how AI researchers are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to improve human health, better understand biological systems, and work towards new diagnostics and therapeutics? In this workshop, we will gain hands-on skill with architecting, training, and evaluating machine learning models on biomedical tasks. Through (simple) case studies, we can better appreciate the potential of AI to revolutionize healthcare and biomedicine. Computer with internet connection required, introductory coding experience recommended.
